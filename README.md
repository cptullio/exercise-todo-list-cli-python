b) You can clone this repository on your local computer:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-todo-list-cli
```

2.
+ You can test your code by typing: `$ python3 test.py`.
+ You can run your code by typing: `$ python3 app.py`.

These are the functions you will have to implement:
